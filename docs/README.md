# Drupal 8 Testing

---

## Introduction

The ultimate guide to write tests for Drupal 8 modules, themes and profiles. It aims to provide sample code and methods to write different types of testings available in core.


## Why here?
There are plenty of documentation on [testing in drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/testing). However we have few reasons to have this documentation

1. Make it easy to write standard tests
2. Developer focused content
3. Easy to keep up with changes (e.g. updating all reference to 8.5.x links on this book at once.)
4. Provide best possible solution available as there are some inconsistency on core tests (e.g. `simpletest` vs `PHPUnit`, `getMock()` vs `prophesize()`).
