# Defining Methods

Methods allow you to smoothly display code examples in different languages.

{% method %}
## My first method

My first method exposes how to print a message in JavaScript and Go.

{% common %}
Whatever language you are using, the result will be the same.

```bash
$ My first method
```

```php5
Class Foo {
  public function get() {
    
  }
}
```
{% endmethod %}
